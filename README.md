# Chiikawa

Website design for a chiikawa fan page

## Site Structure and Navigation

- **Home (`main.html`)**: Landing page with navigation bar linking to all main sections.
- **Story (`pages/Story.html`)**: Page for the Chiikawa story content.
- **Game (`pages/Game.html`)**: Page for Chiikawa-related games or interactive content.
- **Character (`pages/Character.html`)**: Page listing or describing Chiikawa characters.
- **Quiz (`pages/Quiz.html`)**: Page for Chiikawa-themed quizzes.

All pages share a consistent navigation bar at the top:

- The Home button is styled as a large, prominent box.
- Each section is accessible from every page, and the current page is highlighted.
- The navigation bar is responsive and accessible (keyboard and screen reader friendly).

## Styling

- All pages use a shared stylesheet: `css/styles.css`.
- The navigation bar uses modern CSS (flexbox, variables, transitions) for a clean, responsive look.
- The Home button uses a special `.nhome` class for extra emphasis.

## How to Use

- Open `main.html` to start browsing.
- Use the navigation bar to move between Story, Game, Character, and Quiz pages.
- The site is designed to work on both desktop and mobile browsers.
